# DEVELOPMENT_NOTES
## Current project direction
- project name: `specforge`
- CLI/binary name: `specforge`
- implementation language: Rust
- canonical deliverable: `IntentIR`
- product shape: staged IR toolchain, not one-shot backend generation
- stage model: `SourceIR -> EvidenceIR -> SemanticIR -> IntentIR -> adapters`

## Foundational engineering choices
### IntentIR instead of AST
- the final canonical output must capture semantics and implementation-relevant intent, not only syntax structure
- `IntentIR` is therefore a better name and design target than a plain `AST`
- the canonical model must carry assumptions, constraints, abstractions, and residual decisions explicitly

### Backend independence first
- `.fsm` is not the product boundary
- `.fsm`, SystemVerilog, Verilog, and VHDL are adapter targets downstream of `IntentIR`
- the canonical model must not inherit backend-specific assumptions too early

### Typed IR first
- the internal system of record should be typed Rust data, not markdown prose or string templates
- JSON serialization is the first interchange surface for stage artifacts
- markdown docs explain and steer the system, but they must not become the hidden runtime IR

### SOTA document understanding, not markdown-only extraction
- PDFs must be treated as multimodal documents, not as plain text containers
- the preferred architecture is hybrid and provenance-first:
  - structured parser first
  - page and visual asset capture second
  - selective multimodal enrichment for figures, charts, diagrams, and image-heavy regions third
- markdown is a convenient normalized view for humans and some downstream text steps, but it is not the only system of record for PDF sources
- the normalization layer should remain backend-pluggable so `specforge` can keep pace with the state of the art without destabilizing later IR stages

### Staged IR pipeline
- `SourceIR` captures normalized source identity, parser backend choice, page artifacts, visual assets, and ingest intent
- `EvidenceIR` captures text anchors, visual evidence, cross-links between text and figures, extracted statements, and statement classification
- `SemanticIR` captures actors, interfaces, phases, invariants, contracts, gates, assertions, abstractions, and decomposition candidates
- `IntentIR` is the canonical backend-independent intent model
- adapters lower `IntentIR` into concrete targets

### Residual decision packets instead of ad hoc manual gaps
- when automation cannot safely choose a single interpretation, the system should emit a structured residual decision packet
- residual decisions must be explicit in the typed model, not buried in prose
- this keeps the manual surface reviewable and progressively reducible

### Deterministic versus assisted stages
- deterministic stages should own ingest, normalization, artifact materialization, and validation boundaries
- interpretation-heavy stages such as actor discovery and semantic lifting can use assisted reasoning later, but must still emit typed artifacts with provenance

### Continuity as infrastructure
- live documentation is not optional process overhead
- `README.md`, `INTENTIR_SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md`, `RUST_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`, `CHANGES.md`, and `MEMORY.md` are part of the engineering system
- they must be updated when work completes and at meaningful intermediate checkpoints during long-running tasks

## Current repository observations
- the repository now contains a renamed `specforge` crate and CLI
- the active Rust codebase no longer treats `spec2fsm` as the primary identity
- the canonical product boundary is now described consistently as `IntentIR`
- the first real implemented stages are `SourceIR`, `EvidenceIR`, `SemanticIR`, and `IntentIR`
- the repository now also includes `subs/fsmgen` as a pinned git submodule for local `.fsm` reference work during adapter implementation
- `subs/fsmgen` is now explicitly treated as contextual and read-only from `specforge`
- `SourceIR` now includes a real Docling-backed structured PDF materialization path with promoted markdown, page artifacts, visual assets, metadata JSON, and backend raw JSON
- `EvidenceIR` now builds multimodal evidence records instead of remaining text-only scaffolding
- `SemanticIR` now builds a first backend-neutral semantic layer instead of remaining scaffolding only
- `IntentIR` now builds a first canonical backend-neutral intent layer instead of remaining scaffolding only
- the first `.fsm` adapter slice now builds a typed DT-centric adapter artifact instead of leaving adapters as planning-only scaffolding

## Structured PDF normalization implementation
- execute-mode PDF ingest is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/ir/source.rs`
- the backend runner lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/source/docling_backend.rs`
- Rust remains the owner of canonical `SourceIR`, manifest paths, and final `source_ir.json` persistence
- an embedded Python helper drives Docling to materialize:
  - promoted markdown with referenced picture assets
  - page images and per-page metadata sidecars
  - cropped picture and table assets
  - metadata JSON and backend raw JSON
- runtime discovery prefers `python3` or `python` with `docling` importable, and can be overridden with `SPECFORGE_DOCLING_PYTHON`
- tests can override the backend command with `SPECFORGE_DOCLING_HELPER` so `cargo test` exercises the full SourceIR materialization path without depending on a live Docling install
- visual assets now carry a `source_ref` pointing back into backend-native structured output so later stages can ground evidence against the raw parser representation

## First executable EvidenceIR stage
- execute-mode `EvidenceIR` construction is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/commands/evidence.rs`
- the core builder lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/evidence.rs`
- `EvidenceIR::build` now:
  - loads persisted `SourceIR` JSON from disk
  - requires `normalization_status: ready`
  - reads the promoted markdown path from `SourceIR`
  - builds section anchors from markdown headings
  - builds block-level evidence spans with line provenance
  - projects `SourceIR` visual assets into typed visual evidence items
  - links caption spans to visual assets with `describes`
  - links textual `Figure N` / `Fig. N` / `Table N` references with `cites`
  - emits heuristic extracted-statement classes for source facts, derived rules, local design decisions, and explicit abstractions
- the current first-pass implementation is intentionally deterministic and inspectable rather than LLM-driven
- deeper OCR, chart extraction, and richer visual interpretation remain future enrichment work for later EvidenceIR/SemanticIR slices

## First executable SemanticIR stage
- execute-mode `SemanticIR` construction is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/commands/semantic.rs`
- the core builder lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/semantic.rs`
- `SemanticIR::build` now:
  - loads persisted `EvidenceIR` JSON from disk
  - derives artifact layout under `generated/semantic_ir/<document_key>/semantic_ir.json`
  - discovers actors from explicit role terms and falls back to interface-derived channel actors when the evidence names signals but not endpoints
  - discovers interfaces from recurring grouped signal names and preserves typed signal records when explicit declarations are present
  - preserves backend-neutral system contract and init-assignment records from explicit `Clock ...`, `Reset ...`, and `Init ...` statements when the evidence is explicit enough
  - preserves backend-neutral guarded/action control fragments from explicit `Block ...` statements when the evidence is explicit enough
  - derives phases from section structure and sequencing language
  - extracts invariants, contracts, gates, and abstractions from inspectable heuristics over evidence statements
  - emits decomposition candidates from section/topic clustering
  - emits explicit residual decisions when actor boundaries, overlapping interfaces, or ambiguous visual evidence remain unresolved
- the current first-pass implementation remains deterministic and conservative; it is meant to expose candidate semantics and unresolved ambiguity, not to invent a final canonical intent model

## First executable IntentIR stage
- execute-mode `IntentIR` construction is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/commands/intent.rs`
- the core builder lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/intent.rs`
- `IntentIR::build` now:
  - loads persisted `SemanticIR` JSON from disk
  - derives artifact layout under `generated/intent_ir/<document_key>/intent_ir.json`
  - canonicalizes actor responsibilities from semantic actors, contracts, and phase overlap
  - carries forward canonical interface inventory from typed semantic interfaces
  - carries forward canonical backend-neutral system contract and init assignments from typed semantic records
  - carries forward backend-neutral guarded/action control fragments from typed semantic control blocks
  - canonicalizes behaviors from phases, contracts, and gate-like sequencing rules
  - canonicalizes constraints from invariants, assertions, and interface-coupled rules
  - derives assumptions from abstractions and conservative backend-neutral heuristics
  - preserves semantic residual decisions and adds canonicalization-specific residuals only when the intent model would otherwise become speculative
- the current first-pass implementation remains deterministic and conservative; it is meant to produce a stable canonical intent surface before adapter work, not to overfit one backend target

## First executable adapter stage
- execute-mode adapter construction is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/commands/adapt.rs`
- the core builder lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/adapters.rs`
- `AdapterArtifact::build` now:
  - loads persisted `IntentIR` JSON from disk
  - derives typed adapter artifacts under `generated/adapters/fsm/<document_key>/adapter.json`
  - selects a conservative DT-oriented `.fsm` root decision unless the canonical model carries stronger sequencing evidence
  - consumes canonical interface inventory, backend-neutral system/init records, and backend-neutral guarded/action fragments from `IntentIR`
  - emits real standalone `?dt:name` text when every referenced signal has explicit width/direction, every control block is fully typed, and any sequential standalone DT case also has explicit system/init facts
  - preserves upstream residual decisions and emits adapter-side residual decisions only for unresolved signal inventory, system/init surface, deferred control structure, and broader root-kind expansion
  - keeps true `?fsm:name` state modeling and composition cases blocked until the canonical model carries those facts explicitly
- the current renderable slice is still intentionally narrow rather than speculative; it now covers explicit standalone combinational and sequential DT cases while keeping broader root kinds deferred

## Newly completed architectural pivot
- the CLI/crate identity is now `specforge`
- the repo objective has been rewritten around `IntentIR`
- `.fsm` is now documented as an adapter target instead of the core endpoint
- `specforge ingest` now materializes `SourceIR` at `generated/source_ir/<document_key>/source_ir.json`
- explicit scaffolding exists for the full staged pipeline:
  - `SourceIR`
  - `EvidenceIR`
  - `SemanticIR`
  - `IntentIR`
  - adapters
- `INTENTIR_SPEC.md` now records the canonical long-form architecture and examples for future implementation work

## Immediate implementation consequences
- do not jump to `.fsm` generation from `SourceIR`
- keep the current `SourceIR`, `EvidenceIR`, `SemanticIR`, and `IntentIR` types stable enough that later adapter builders can depend on them
- use the newly materialized `IntentIR` actors, interface inventory, control fragments, behaviors, constraints, assumptions, and residual decisions as the substrate for adapter lowerings
- use `subs/fsmgen` as a local reference implementation for `.fsm` expectations and comparisons, but do not let that reference redefine the canonical `IntentIR` boundary
- do not edit `subs/fsmgen` from this repository; if upstream behavior appears wrong, file a thorough local tracked bug report instead
- use the local upstream bug-report ID format `FSMGEN-BUG-####` when such issues are found
- keep the current `EvidenceIR`, `SemanticIR`, and `IntentIR` passes provenance-first so later adapter lowering stays grounded
- do not let figures, charts, or diagrams collapse into throwaway markdown placeholders if they may carry normative meaning

## Immediate next engineering target
- promote explicit regular-state and transition facts for honest `?fsm:name` lowering without leaking backend syntax into the canonical model
- keep composition roots and broader module/top structure deferred until the canonical model carries them explicitly
