# DEVELOPMENT_NOTES
## Current project direction
- project name: `specforge`
- CLI/binary name: `specforge`
- implementation language: Rust
- canonical deliverable: `IntentIR`
- product shape: staged IR toolchain, not one-shot backend generation
- stage model: `SourceIR -> EvidenceIR -> SemanticIR -> IntentIR -> adapters`

## Foundational engineering choices
### IntentIR instead of AST
- the final canonical output must capture semantics and implementation-relevant intent, not only syntax structure
- `IntentIR` is therefore a better name and design target than a plain `AST`
- the canonical model must carry assumptions, constraints, abstractions, and residual decisions explicitly

### Backend independence first
- `.fsm` is not the product boundary
- `.fsm`, SystemVerilog, Verilog, and VHDL are adapter targets downstream of `IntentIR`
- the canonical model must not inherit backend-specific assumptions too early

### Typed IR first
- the internal system of record should be typed Rust data, not markdown prose or string templates
- JSON serialization is the first interchange surface for stage artifacts
- markdown docs explain and steer the system, but they must not become the hidden runtime IR

### SOTA document understanding, not markdown-only extraction
- PDFs must be treated as multimodal documents, not as plain text containers
- the preferred architecture is hybrid and provenance-first:
  - structured parser first
  - page and visual asset capture second
  - selective multimodal enrichment for figures, charts, diagrams, and image-heavy regions third
- markdown is a convenient normalized view for humans and some downstream text steps, but it is not the only system of record for PDF sources
- the normalization layer should remain backend-pluggable so `specforge` can keep pace with the state of the art without destabilizing later IR stages

### Staged IR pipeline
- `SourceIR` captures normalized source identity, parser backend choice, page artifacts, visual assets, and ingest intent
- `EvidenceIR` captures text anchors, visual evidence, cross-links between text and figures, extracted statements, and statement classification
- `SemanticIR` captures actors, interfaces, phases, invariants, contracts, gates, assertions, abstractions, and decomposition candidates
- `IntentIR` is the canonical backend-independent intent model
- adapters lower `IntentIR` into concrete targets

### Residual decision packets instead of ad hoc manual gaps
- when automation cannot safely choose a single interpretation, the system should emit a structured residual decision packet
- residual decisions must be explicit in the typed model, not buried in prose
- this keeps the manual surface reviewable and progressively reducible

### Deterministic versus assisted stages
- deterministic stages should own ingest, normalization, artifact materialization, and validation boundaries
- interpretation-heavy stages such as actor discovery and semantic lifting can use assisted reasoning later, but must still emit typed artifacts with provenance

### Continuity as infrastructure
- live documentation is not optional process overhead
- `README.md`, `INTENTIR_SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md`, `RUST_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`, `CHANGES.md`, and `MEMORY.md` are part of the engineering system
- they must be updated when work completes and at meaningful intermediate checkpoints during long-running tasks

## Current repository observations
- the repository now contains a renamed `specforge` crate and CLI
- the active Rust codebase no longer treats `spec2fsm` as the primary identity
- the canonical product boundary is now described consistently as `IntentIR`
- the first real implemented stage is `SourceIR`
- `SourceIR` now includes a real Docling-backed structured PDF materialization path with promoted markdown, page artifacts, visual assets, metadata JSON, and backend raw JSON
- `EvidenceIR` now reserves multimodal evidence records instead of assuming text-only extraction

## Structured PDF normalization implementation
- execute-mode PDF ingest is now orchestrated from `crates/specforge/src/ir/source.rs`
- the backend runner lives in `crates/specforge/src/ir/source/docling_backend.rs`
- Rust remains the owner of canonical `SourceIR`, manifest paths, and final `source_ir.json` persistence
- an embedded Python helper drives Docling to materialize:
  - promoted markdown with referenced picture assets
  - page images and per-page metadata sidecars
  - cropped picture and table assets
  - metadata JSON and backend raw JSON
- runtime discovery prefers `python3` or `python` with `docling` importable, and can be overridden with `SPECFORGE_DOCLING_PYTHON`
- tests can override the backend command with `SPECFORGE_DOCLING_HELPER` so `cargo test` exercises the full SourceIR materialization path without depending on a live Docling install
- visual assets now carry a `source_ref` pointing back into backend-native structured output so later stages can ground evidence against the raw parser representation

## Documentation surface currently steering the implementation
- `README.md`
  - single entry point and quick orientation
- `INTENTIR_SPEC.md`
  - canonical architecture and stage specification
- `ROADMAP.md`
  - live implementation sequence
- `RUST_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - architecture/risk assessment
- `USER_GUIDE.md`
  - current and planned CLI/user workflow
- `MEMORY.md`
  - continuity record for restart/handoff

## Current Rust code boundaries
### Workspace shape
- root workspace manifest: `Cargo.toml`
- active CLI crate: `crates/specforge`

### Module boundaries
- `src/main.rs`
  - binary entrypoint
- `src/lib.rs`
  - command dispatch and module exports
- `src/cli.rs`
  - clap CLI model for `specforge`
- `src/error.rs`
  - typed error/result boundary
- `src/commands/inspect.rs`
  - source/path inspection command
- `src/commands/ingest.rs`
  - `SourceIR` preview/materialization command
- `src/ir/mod.rs`
  - stage identifiers and IR namespace
- `src/ir/source.rs`
  - `SourceIR` types, normalization planning, parser backend selection, page/visual artifact manifests, and source-side residual decisions
- `src/ir/source/docling_backend.rs`
  - runtime backend discovery, external Docling orchestration, and the embedded Python helper for structured PDF materialization
- `src/ir/evidence.rs`
  - multimodal `EvidenceIR` scaffolding for text, figures, captions, and visual evidence
- `src/ir/semantic.rs`
  - `SemanticIR` scaffolding
- `src/ir/intent.rs`
  - `IntentIR` scaffolding
- `src/ir/adapters.rs`
  - adapter targets and planning scaffolding

## Newly completed architectural pivot
- the CLI/crate identity is now `specforge`
- the repo objective has been rewritten around `IntentIR`
- `.fsm` is now documented as an adapter target instead of the core endpoint
- `specforge ingest` now materializes `SourceIR` at `generated/source_ir/<document_key>/source_ir.json`
- explicit scaffolding exists for the full staged pipeline:
  - `SourceIR`
  - `EvidenceIR`
  - `SemanticIR`
  - `IntentIR`
  - adapters
- `INTENTIR_SPEC.md` now records the canonical long-form architecture and examples for future implementation work

## Immediate implementation consequences
- do not jump to `.fsm` generation from `SourceIR`
- keep the current `SourceIR` types stable enough that later `EvidenceIR` builders can depend on them
- use the newly materialized `SourceIR` page, visual-asset, and backend-raw artifacts as the substrate for the first real `EvidenceIR` extractor
- make the first `EvidenceIR` pass visual-aware so the staged pipeline becomes real beyond the initial source layer
- do not let figures, charts, or diagrams collapse into throwaway markdown placeholders if they may carry normative meaning

## Immediate next engineering target
- build the first real `EvidenceIR` extractor from normalized markdown, figures, captions, and page assets
