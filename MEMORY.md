# MEMORY
## Purpose
- maintain a compact, actionable continuity record for interrupted sessions
- preserve enough context to resume cleanly after session loss, tool restart, machine crash, or model handoff

## Current project identity
- repository name: `specforge`
- CLI/binary name: `specforge`
- implementation language: Rust
- canonical deliverable: `IntentIR`
- stage model: `SourceIR -> EvidenceIR -> SemanticIR -> IntentIR -> adapters`

## User-required continuity rules
- follow `COMMIT.md` strictly after every completed slice
- sync all relevant tracked live docs before commit, not as an afterthought
- `git_message_brief.txt` must stay untracked and be truncated to `0` bytes after each commit
- every completion message must report the commit id, exact commit message, full tracked-file list, current live-status snapshot, and whether that snapshot changed
- do not push unless the user asks or the branch reaches `25` local commits since the last push
- keep repo-internal paths in tracked markdown relative, never checkout-specific absolute paths

## Latest committed baseline
- latest_commit_hash: `9278b18`
- latest_commit_brief_message: `docs(memory): sync explicit clock grounding baseline`
- note: the latest committed baseline captures the explicit local clock-grounding slice, including `clock_signal` override from timing prose like `rising edge of HCLK`

## Current repository state
- active workspace member: `crates/specforge`
- branch: `main`
- branch state before the next commit: `in sync with origin/main`
- push policy remains local-only for now; do not push in this slice
- modified tracked files:
  - `CHANGES.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`
  - `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md`
  - `MEMORY.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `RUST_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - `crates/specforge/src/commands/validate.rs`
  - `crates/specforge/src/ir/semantic.rs`
  - `docs/book/src/domain/temporal-semantics.md`
- the current feature slice is implemented, documented, and validated locally; the next step is the feature commit, followed by the required continuity refresh commit
- do not push after this slice unless the user asks or the branch reaches the threshold again

## Latest landed slice
- outcome:
  - signal-leading local clock phrases now ground `clock_signal` too, not just edge-leading phrases
  - `HCLK rising edge` now preserves `clock_signal = HCLK`
  - `HCLK posedge` now counts as fully grounded local clock text for validation purposes
  - the explicit local clock detector now covers both prose-style and shorthand signal-leading edge order without widening into fuzzy clock guessing
- verification passed for the in-flight slice:
  - `cargo fmt --all`
  - `cargo test -p specforge signal_leading_rising_edge_text`
  - `cargo test -p specforge signal_leading_clock_text`
  - `cargo test -p specforge cycle_window`
  - `cargo test -p specforge kg_bench_runs_tracked_fixtures`
  - `bash scripts/run_docs_ci.sh`
  - `bash scripts/run_ci.sh`
  - `git diff --check`
- current full local CI baseline after the in-flight changes: `443` Rust tests plus warning-deny rustdoc and the mdBook build
- current tracked KG-quality suite size: `103` fixtures

## Next exact steps
- write the feature commit message into `git_message_brief.txt`
- stage only the intended tracked files for the signal-leading clock-grounding slice
- commit the feature slice with `git commit -F git_message_brief.txt`
- truncate `git_message_brief.txt` back to `0` bytes and verify it remains untracked
- refresh `MEMORY.md` so it points at the newly created feature commit
- commit the continuity refresh with `git commit -F git_message_brief.txt`
- truncate `git_message_brief.txt` back to `0` bytes and verify the worktree is clean except for the expected branch marker
