# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A of `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`; overwrite-only, keep small)

> This file is the bounded **resume pointer**. It describes *now*, not the journey. History lives in
> `git log`; work state lives in the task-trees (`docs/tasks/`); durable facts/decisions live in
> `docs/decisions/`. Do **not** append session narration — overwrite the "Current state" block.

## How to resume (any AI, any harness)
- Derive the current revision on read with `git rev-parse HEAD`; never store a latest-commit shadow.
- Read `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` (memory system), `DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md` (doctrines are mechanically
  gated), and `README.md` (the project).
- All work is tracked in task-trees under `docs/tasks/` (index: `docs/TASK_TREE.md`); follow `COMMIT.md`
  after every slice (unit id in the commit subject).
- Non-negotiable doctrine: `docs/decisions/0003-task-tree-and-commit-doctrine.md` (no code change without
  an owning task-tree first; signoff quality; zero ROADMAP↔code↔mdBook drift; push ~every 200 commits;
  artifact cleanup ≥ every 24h).
- Before committing run `scripts/check_doctrines.sh`; hooks + CI run it too. Retrieval starts at bounded
  `KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md`, then its linked question shards.

## Current state (OVERWRITE this block each update — do not append)
- Active unit: `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.3a.1` owns the bounded current-claim census producer.
  Tracking-only: `STATUS-LEDGER-ROLLOVER.2`, `TASK-PART-SEAL-REACHABILITY.0`,
  `CLAIM-VERIFICATION-ADOPTION.1a`, and `LIVE-DOCUMENT-PRESSURE-HEADROOM.1`.
- Current state: `.3a.1`'s bounded inventory contract derives 39 current surfaces, assigns 32 to inspection and
  seven to explicit exclusions across five views, emits 47 deterministic candidates, and passes 14 fault cases.
  It intentionally freezes no authority outcomes and changes no source assertion.
  `[claim: current-claim-census-inventory]`
- Next action: commit `.3a.1`, then activate `.3a.2` and adjudicate every included surface into exact frozen
  authority outcomes and the `.3b` repair frontier. `MEMORY.md` remains capped at 32,768 B.
- In-flight uncommitted: `.3a.1` implementation and lockstep documentation await final gates; no background job.
- Blockers: none. The user-owned `.claude/settings.json` is untouched.
