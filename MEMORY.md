# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A of `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`; overwrite-only, keep small)

> This file is the bounded **resume pointer**. It describes *now*, not the journey.
> History lives in `git log`; work state lives in the task-trees
> (`docs/tasks/`); durable facts/decisions live in `docs/decisions/`. Do **not** append
> session narration here — overwrite the "Current state" block instead.
> (The prior ever-growing MEMORY.md is preserved in git history before commit `6d668eb2`.)

## How to resume (any AI, any harness)
- Read `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` (memory system), `DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md` (the 4th
  architecture — doctrines are mechanically gated), and `README.md` (the project).
- All work is tracked in task-trees under `docs/tasks/` (index: `docs/TASK_TREE.md`);
  follow `COMMIT.md` after every slice (unit id in the commit subject).
- Non-negotiable doctrine: see `docs/decisions/0003-task-tree-and-commit-doctrine.md`
  (no code change without an owning task-tree first; signoff quality; zero
  ROADMAP↔code↔mdBook drift; push ~every 200 commits; artifact cleanup ≥ every 24h).
- Before committing run `scripts/check_doctrines.sh` (the registry/driver for memory,
  knowledge-map, task-acceptance, README policy, and live-document containment); hooks + CI
  run it too. Retrieval: `KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md`.

## Current state (OVERWRITE this block each update — do not append)
- Active unit: `LIVE-DOCUMENT-SIZE-CONTAINMENT-ADOPTION.3c` — prove every lifecycle and
  registry/control path fails closed, then close `.3` route/surface integration.
- Current state: `.0`–`.2` and `.3a`/`.3b` are complete. The fifth doctrine governs all
  553 Markdown files across 24 surfaces; README is 128 lines/4,908 bytes. No historical
  live document has yet been deleted or migrated. Query revision from Git.
- Next action: implement repository-volume fixture tests for every lifecycle and independent
  failure axis, then verify the full `.3` acceptance contract before migration.
- In-flight uncommitted: `.3b` atomic doctrine/registry/checker slice until commit; none afterward.
- Blockers: none. The user-owned `.claude/settings.json` remains untouched.
