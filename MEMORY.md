# MEMORY
## Purpose
- maintain a compact, actionable continuity record for interrupted sessions
- preserve enough context to resume cleanly after session loss, tool restart, machine crash, or model handoff

## Current project identity
- repository name: `specforge`
- CLI/binary name: `specforge`
- implementation language: Rust
- canonical deliverable: `IntentIR`
- stage model: `SourceIR -> EvidenceIR -> SemanticIR -> IntentIR -> adapters`

## User-required continuity rules
- follow `COMMIT.md` strictly after every completed slice
- sync all relevant tracked live docs before commit, not as an afterthought
- `git_message_brief.txt` must stay untracked and be truncated to `0` bytes after each commit
- every completion message must report the commit id, exact commit message, full tracked-file list, current live-status snapshot, and whether that snapshot changed
- do not push unless the user asks or the branch reaches `25` local commits since the last push
- keep repo-internal paths in tracked markdown relative, never checkout-specific absolute paths

## Latest committed baseline
- latest_commit_hash: `c63dd66`
- latest_commit_brief_message: `feat(temporal): recover named diagram-edge positions`
- note: the latest committed baseline captures the named diagram-style generic-edge slice where phrases like `HCLK edge T3` and `edge T3 of HCLK` now preserve both exact bounded timing and the local `clock_signal`

## Current repository state
- active workspace member: `crates/specforge`
- branch: `main`
- branch state before the next commit: `ahead 14` of `origin/main`
- push policy remains local-only for now; do not push in this slice
- modified tracked files:
  - `CHANGES.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`
  - `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md`
  - `MEMORY.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `RUST_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - `crates/specforge/src/commands/validate.rs`
  - `crates/specforge/src/ir/semantic.rs`
  - `docs/book/src/domain/temporal-semantics.md`
- the feature slice is already committed; only the required continuity refresh commit remains
- do not push after this slice unless the user asks or the branch reaches the threshold again

## Latest landed slice
- outcome:
  - unit-first diagram-position timing such as `tick T3 of HCLK`, `posedge T4 of HCLK`, and `rising edge T5 of HCLK` now preserves the local `clock_signal`
  - the exact bounded `cycle_window` path for those phrases stays unchanged; this slice completes the local clock grounding instead of changing the timing window semantics
  - the widening stays bounded to explicit unit-first diagram positions that end in `of <known clock>`; arbitrary unit-first timing text still does not become a clock guess
- verification passed:
  - `cargo fmt --all`
  - `cargo test -p specforge unit_first_diagram_position`
  - `cargo test -p specforge extracts_unit_first_diagram_position_of_clock_phrases`
  - `cargo test -p specforge cycle_window`
  - `cargo test -p specforge kg_bench_runs_tracked_fixtures`
  - `bash scripts/run_docs_ci.sh`
  - `bash scripts/run_ci.sh`
  - `git diff --check`
- current full local CI baseline after the latest landed slice: `461` Rust tests plus warning-deny rustdoc and the mdBook build
- current tracked KG-quality suite size: `103` fixtures

## Next exact steps
- write the feature commit message into `git_message_brief.txt`
- stage only the intended tracked files for the feature slice
- commit the feature slice with `git commit -F git_message_brief.txt`
- truncate `git_message_brief.txt` back to `0` bytes and verify the post-conditions
- refresh `MEMORY.md` to the new feature-commit baseline, then land the required memory-only continuity commit
