# PDF-VARIANT-DIGESTION: make SpecForge digest as many chip-spec PDF variants as possible

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `PDF-VARIANT-DIGESTION`
- Status: `active` (high-priority program)
- Roadmap lane: `R15`/`R16` (ingestion + extraction breadth)
- Created: `2026-06-07`
- Parent: owner high-priority directive — "make SPECFORGE capable to handle any chip-spec PDF we can throw
  at it, that's the dream, the aim … we should do everything we can to get as close as possible." Defer
  IntentIR→ISF lowering. (`project_pdf_variant_digestion` memory.)

## Goal (the aim)

SpecForge ingests and meaningfully extracts intent from **any chip-spec PDF** — across every vendor, doc
type, and layout. The concrete near-term target is the **82-PDF library** (ARM AMBA/debug/system-IP/ISA/
TRMs, CXL/OpenCAPI/CCIX, USB-IF, RISC-V, Intel/AMD, JEDEC, NXP, NVMe, OpenCores) plus whatever the owner
adds. "Digest" = ingest cleanly (no crash / handle protection) AND produce non-garbage typed extraction
appropriate to the doc (signals/constraints/relations/temporal/FSM/registers/encodings), or an honest
diagnostic when a construct is genuinely out of model.

## Non-goals

- NOT IntentIR→ISF lowering (deferred by the owner; revisit later).
- Do NOT regress the four wire-based specs: APB/AHB/AXI = 100% (constraints/relations/temporal),
  SWD = 100% (frame/operations/FSM). kg-bench stays green.
- Not perfect extraction of every fact in a 1000-page ISA manual — meaningful, measured progress per class.

## Acceptance criteria

- A triage matrix over the corpus: per PDF, ingest status + extraction stats (tables/kinds/signals/
  constraints/relations) — so coverage is measured, not guessed.
- Each addressed variant CLASS: a general feature (ADR-0006-safe, no hardcoded chip names) that unlocks it,
  + a regression PDF copied into `corpus/` + git-tracked, + per-fact measurement where a gold applies.
- No regression on the four wire-based specs; full `scripts/run_ci.sh` green; KM card per durable finding.

## Task tree

- ID: `PDF-VARIANT-DIGESTION` · Status: `active` · Children: `.1` (triage) + per-class feature leaves (TBD)
- ID: `PDF-VARIANT-DIGESTION.1` · Status: `in_progress` · Goal: **triage sweep** — ingest a diverse sample
  (one per family: ARM-TRM GIC-400, Wishbone, NXP I2C, RISC-V Debug, CCIX, Avalon, USB4, OpenCAPI) through
  `ingest`→`evidence`, record ingest status + table-kind census + extraction stats, and identify the
  per-variant FAILURE MODES (ingest crash / password protection / empty or garbage extraction / non-table
  structures / missing catalogs). Output `/tmp/digest_triage.txt` → distilled into this tree + KM. Then
  decompose into per-class feature leaves prioritized by impact (how many of the 82 each unlocks).

## Current frontier

- `PDF-VARIANT-DIGESTION.1` — triage sweep (running). Next: read the matrix, pick the highest-impact
  failure class, add the general feature, copy a regression PDF, measure, repeat.

## Decisions

- Triage-first: measure what breaks across variants before building, so features target real gaps (the
  owner's measure/think-before-coding ethos).
- Operate ingestion from the owner library for the survey; copy a PDF into `corpus/` + git-track it only
  when SpecForge gains a feature for it (do NOT log the library path — `feedback_source_pdfs_in_repo`).

## Open questions

- Which variant classes are highest-impact (unlock the most of the 82)? — answered by `.1`.
- How to score "digestion" for non-signal-table docs (TRMs/ISA manuals) — a coverage/quality gauge vs a
  per-fact gold?

## Blockers

- None. (Some PDFs may be password-protected — e.g. the ADI one — or very large; expect and handle.)

## Verification log

- `.1`: triage sweep launched `2026-06-07` over 8 diverse families.

## Changelog

- `2026-06-07`: Created (owner high-priority directive — digest any chip-spec PDF). `.1` triage sweep in flight.
