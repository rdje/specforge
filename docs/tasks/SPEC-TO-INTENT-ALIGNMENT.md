# SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT: steer PDF evidence into complete executable-intent IR

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: extraction quality and breadth
- Created: `2026-08-11`
- Last updated: `2026-08-11`
- Owner: project owner and repo-local workflow

## Goal

Keep SpecForge converging on its specification-to-executable-intent endpoint by making faithful PDF-to-IR
population the present program constraint, measuring the semantic content that survives every IR boundary,
and integrating production extraction capabilities into the canonical path before treating downstream ISF
expressiveness as the bottleneck.

## Non-Goals

- Do not weaken the specification-to-executable-intent north star.
- Do not expand ISF or FSMGen speculatively. Their active development can absorb demonstrated language gaps
  after upstream IR contains the source semantics that expose those gaps.
- Do not equate strict-valid `.isf`, passing unit tests, artifact currency, or an honest blocked emission with
  complete source-intent recovery.
- Do not refactor large IR modules without a measured extraction or integration need.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The evidence-backed trajectory assessment and the owner's PDF-to-IR priority decision are durable outside
  chat, with contradictions and unknowns stated explicitly.
- The automatic-steering design reuses existing completeness instruments, defines convergence/divergence/stall
  without a gameable blended score, and leaves canonical semantic mutation review-gated.
- The roadmap and mdBook state one current order: source capture and complete canonical IR first; demonstrated
  ISF/FSMGen gaps later.
- Each supported document category receives a measurable source-evidence-to-IntentIR content contract.
- The canonical production workflow accounts for every production extractor: integrated, deliberately
  scheduled, or explicitly blocked with a reason.
- Real multimodal inputs reach their typed IR consumers; synthetic downstream coverage is not reported as an
  operational PDF capability.
- Semantic recall, precision, provenance, residuals, and stage loss are evaluated on held-out vertical slices.
- Each completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md` after focused and doctrine verification.

## Task Tree

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: `make PDF-to-IR semantic capture, not speculative ISF breadth, the measured path to executable intent`
  Children: `.0`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, `.4`, `.5`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.0`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `persist the code/roadmap/book trajectory assessment and the owner's upstream-first direction`
  Acceptance: `an ADR, Knowledge Map fact card, roadmap, current-status surface, mdBook, and resume pointer agree that PDF-to-IR completeness is the current constraint; concrete implementation gaps are separated from inference; all documentation and doctrine gates pass`
  Verification: `full run_ci gate passes: all 8 doctrines, formatting, clippy with warnings denied, 1,810 Rust tests passed / 5 ignored / 0 failed, Rust docs, mdBook examples/build, and post-producer project-data-locality; focused Knowledge Map, task catalog, canonical catalog, live-size, and book-current-truth checks pass`
  Commit: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.0 — fix the upstream objective and trajectory control`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `define the per-document-category evidence-to-IntentIR content and completeness contract`
  Acceptance: `each supported category names required source modalities, typed IR surfaces, provenance and residual outcomes, measurable recall/precision floors, and honest non-applicable content without using ISF emission as the upstream completeness proxy`
  Verification: `the versioned machine-readable contract covers all six categories and passes strict semantic validation; mdBook test/build, Knowledge Map derive/check, fact-card catalog, 66 focused completeness tests, all doctrine checks, and the full repository CI gate pass`
  Commit: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.1 — define source-to-IntentIR category contracts`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `make the canonical production workflow account for every production extraction capability`
  Acceptance: `the default workflow invokes, deliberately schedules, or explicitly reports omission of contract extraction, relation resolution, register recovery, NLI enforcement, and other production stages; tests prevent capability islands from being mistaken for end-to-end delivery`
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `close the real PDF-to-typed-multimodal-IR producer gap`
  Acceptance: `real PDF figure/table/layout evidence reaches the typed consumers needed for semantic recovery; FigureRegion/waveform support is exercised from a real source fixture or is reported as unavailable, never inferred from synthetic-only downstream tests`
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `prove trajectory with held-out source-to-IntentIR vertical slices and stage-loss accounting`
  Acceptance: `representative held-out PDFs have reviewed intent gold, per-stage survival/loss accounting, recall/precision/provenance/residual results, and an explicit conclusion about which remaining blocker is upstream extraction versus demonstrated ISF expressiveness`
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `build an evidence-driven trajectory controller that detects convergence, stall, and divergence and proposes the next highest-value owned slice`
  Acceptance: `a machine-readable objective contract drives a multidimensional trajectory snapshot; held-out semantic outcomes, per-stage loss, modality/category coverage, residual debt, canonical-path participation, and hard honesty gates are measured; statistically justified drift/stall rules cannot be hidden by a blended score; recommended work is task-tree-owned and remains human-reviewable`
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.0` | `done` | assessment, owner direction, and controller design are durable and verified |
| 2 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.1` | `done` | six category-aware source-to-IntentIR contracts and strict honesty floors are durable |
| 3 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.2` | `pending` | next: prevent standalone capability from being counted as canonical-path capability |
| 4 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.3` | `pending` | replace multimodal architectural dormancy with real upstream input |
| 5 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.4` | `pending` | measure whether the complete pipeline is actually converging |
| 6 | `SPEC-TO-INTENT-ALIGNMENT.5` | `pending` | convert measured outcomes into automatic, reviewable steering |

## Decisions

- `2026-08-11`: retain the specification-to-executable-intent objective; clarify and measure it rather than
  narrowing it to what the current pipeline happens to emit.
- `2026-08-11`: the project owner identifies faithful content population from PDFs through the IR pipeline as
  the present bottleneck. ISF is not the blocking point now; defer language expansion until populated IntentIR
  exposes a concrete, source-grounded expressiveness gap.
- `2026-08-11`: treat the current codebase as architecturally convergent but not yet product-complete. Passing
  gates establish implementation integrity, not semantic completeness.
- `2026-08-11`: do not use raw `.isf` emission count as the sole completion measure. Honest non-emission is
  evidence of anti-fabrication, but upstream coverage still needs an independent content oracle.
- `2026-08-11`: automatic steering will compose existing exact snapshots, gold evaluation, region accounting,
  closure invariants, recall estimates, and residuals into a versioned objective vector. It may gate exact
  invariants and propose the next owned task; it may not silently promote canonical semantic truth (ADR 0034).
- `2026-08-11`: category completeness is judged per reviewed source meaning and required modality, with exact
  precision/recall and conservation/provenance floors. A residual preserves loss honestly but does not satisfy
  the typed-content requirement it replaces.
- `2026-08-11`: non-applicability requires independent evidence that the source content is absent. A blocked
  adapter or zero emitted ISF is never sufficient evidence that upstream capture is complete.

## Open Questions

- Which representative PDFs form the first held-out category set for `.1` and `.4`?
- Which existing extractor commands should be composed directly into `converge`, and which should remain
  explicitly scheduled passes because of provider cost or review requirements?

## Blockers

- None for `.2`. Optional local model runtimes were unavailable during startup diagnostics, but `.2` begins
  with provider-free orchestration and code-path accounting.

## Changelog

- `2026-08-11`: Created on owner request so the ramp-up trajectory assessment and upstream-first direction do
  not remain chat-only.
- `2026-08-11`: Added the automatic-steering design request as `.5`; ADR 0033/0034 and the research design own
  the upstream-first sequence and reviewable multi-metric controller.
- `2026-08-11`: Closed `.0` after focused projection checks and the full repository gate; frontier advances
  to `.1`, the per-document-category EvidenceIR-to-IntentIR content contract.
- `2026-08-11`: Closed `.1` with strict, source-grounded acceptance for all six categories; frontier advances
  to `.2`, canonical production-workflow capability accounting.
