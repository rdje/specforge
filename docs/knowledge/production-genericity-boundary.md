A neutral SpecForge is feasible when universal digital-intent semantics are separated from opaque,
document-derived symbols and provenance-bearing proposals. It cannot promise perfect recovery from
missing or ambiguous source information; it must residualize that uncertainty. Genericity is proved
by production module/type boundaries, registered grammar access, and renaming/identity/paraphrase
invariance—not by a finite token denylist. The canonical audit and enforcement design are in
`docs/research/production-genericity-pipeline-audit.md`; ADR 0006 owns the invariant.
