# EvidenceIR

`EvidenceIR` is where the pipeline starts lifting grounded facts out of the source.

## What belongs in `EvidenceIR`

- extracted statements
- section anchors
- evidence spans
- visual evidence
- figure/caption links
- actor-signal relations
- early signal facts
- semantic hints
- polarity evidence

This is the first stage where the system begins to say:

- "this table row looks like a signal declaration"
- "this prose sentence looks like a constraint"
- "this caption appears to ground a semantic role"
- "this visual observation may support a timing fact"

## The mindset of this stage

This is still an evidence layer, not the final semantic truth.

So the right behavior is:

- extract what the document supports
- preserve provenance
- keep conflicting evidence visible
- avoid over-promoting generic examples into canonical interface truth

That last point matters a lot.
`EvidenceIR` is not supposed to be clever in the sense of inventing final meaning.
It is supposed to be disciplined in the sense of preserving recoverable evidence without silently flattening ambiguity.

## Typical evidence-level wins

- source/destination table recovery
- table-grounded widths
- prose-grounded actor relations
- visual-caption semantic hints
- VLM timing-note observations
- polarity extraction, including explicit asserted-when-level prose such as `CS_N is asserted when LOW`, unambiguous collective prose such as `CS_N and WE_N are active LOW signals`, and safe clause-local mixed prose such as `CS_N is active LOW and ENABLE is active HIGH`
- negative-knowledge caution surfacing during validation

These wins are valuable because they give later stages something much stronger than free-form text:

- typed hints
- grounded spans
- table-linked facts
- visual-evidence references
- early KG edges
- explicit caution signals

The dedicated [Multimodal Evidence And Visual Grounding](multimodal-evidence.md) chapter explains the visual part of that evidence flow in more detail.

## What this stage is allowed to do

`EvidenceIR` is allowed to extract and classify.

It is allowed to say:

- this sentence is a constraint-like statement
- this signal appears in a relation-like table row
- this caption text supports a semantic-role hint
- this table suggests a width, polarity, or source/destination relation

It can also apply a collective polarity statement to multiple declared controls when the wording has one unambiguous active level.
For example, `CS_N and WE_N are active LOW signals` can ground both controls as active-low.
Mixed compound wording such as `CS_N is active LOW and ENABLE is active HIGH` can be recovered only when the clause-local parser can split and validate every signal-level pair safely.
If a polarity phrase is detached from an explicit signal, the statement stays unresolved instead of borrowing an implicit subject.

It is not supposed to decide the final canonical meaning of the whole interface.
Likewise, negative-knowledge priors may make validation more alert to a repeated evidence-stage conflict pattern, but they do not suppress the current evidence or decide the conflict.
When that happens, validation can also mark the matched current conflict as rescan/corroboration guidance through `evidence_negative_knowledge_rescan_guidance`.
Later `SemanticIR` and `IntentIR` validation carry the same caution idea forward for repeated conflict and residual shapes.

## Typical evidence-level failure modes

- field tables leaking fake signals
- abstract example tables pretending to be real interfaces
- payload nouns being promoted to actors
- signal names creating semantic meaning by spelling alone

Many of the project’s recent truthfulness slices have been about tightening exactly those boundaries.

## Why provenance is critical here

`EvidenceIR` is where the project first needs to defend itself against "plausible but wrong" extraction.

That is why evidence records carry things like:

- supporting statement ids
- supporting table ids
- supporting visual evidence ids
- automation confidence

Without that provenance, later semantic arbitration would not have enough context to judge which evidence is strong, weak, conflicting, or merely suggestive.

## What a good `EvidenceIR` artifact looks like

A good evidence artifact is not one that looks clean at all costs.

It is one that:

- extracts a lot of grounded candidate knowledge
- preserves where that knowledge came from
- keeps disagreement visible
- avoids creating false structure from generic or noisy inputs

That makes `EvidenceIR` the main staging area for truthfulness before canonical semantics begin.
